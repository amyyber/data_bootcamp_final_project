Project Description:
The dataset is created by Mohan S Acharya to estimate chances of graduate admission from an Indian perspective. For this project, we analyzed the impact of factors, such as GRE scores, CGPA, etc., in the graduate admission process. We also trained different models to help predict students' admission chance given the rest of the variables.
